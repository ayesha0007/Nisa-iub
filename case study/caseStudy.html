            <p>Dr. Christopher Apostol, DO, and the team at ASP Medical Group worked to survey “The Current State of Mental Healthcare in Bangladesh.” To offer patients, especially those dealing with complex mental health issues, designed to deliver a higher level of care to those who need it.</p>
            
            <p>However, both IT and staffing challenges made it difficult for the practice to get the program up and running over their important day-to-day needs. "As a result, we were unable to meet the expectations of the complex mental health issues in the initial phase," said Dr. Apostol. "But with Dorri’s technology, we were able to implement a system that identified these problems much earlier in the process and helped us address them more effectively. Thanks to Dorri, our patients are getting the care they need faster and more efficiently. In the initial months of this program, I'm seeing fewer mental health problems in general, less demand for prescription medications, and happier, healthier patients overall. To that we support you in your first step.”</p>

            <p>Getting their program up and running with Dorri Chronic Care Management Services has been a success for the entire staff at ASP Medical Group. Unlike other technologies that attempt to provide similar services, Dorri is designed to help improve the overall efficiency and quality of care for the patients they serve. "Our patients now get the right level of care they need from day one, not months after they've been struggling with their mental health issues," said Dr. Apostol. "I'm seeing fewer patients relapsing, I'm seeing fewer prescription issues, and overall, I'm seeing our patients have a better quality of life. I'm going to see a happier patient population."</p>
